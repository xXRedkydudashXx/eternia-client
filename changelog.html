    <li>Added <span class="gradient-text" style="background-image: linear-gradient(90deg, #d09bff, #ac1aff, #d09bff);"><b>Singularity Cannon</b></span></li>
    <ul>
      <li>A massive cannon that fires singularities. Its gravitational field absorbs food and tanks in its path, and upon death, it releases a powerful deflagration that pushes back all nearby entities</li>
      <li>Note that this is a nerfed version of the tank, this was supposed to be able to :</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The black hole's size would increase depending on the player score</li>
        <li>Able to switch to its second form, which is the opposite : Firing repulsive singularities and implodes at the end</li>
        <li>Being able to teleport with a 1 min cooldown, upon arrival would release a powerful shockwave</li>
        <li>Have custom interface with loading animation</li>
        <li>But sadly due to lack of time until glitch is taken down (07/08/2025), I decided to release it earlier so people would still be able to enjoy it</li>
      </ul>
      <li>The gravitational fields affects most of minibosses</li>
