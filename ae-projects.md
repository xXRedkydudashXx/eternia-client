## Currently working on :
- AWP-JX :
  - 1, 2, 3 are fully done, 4 is under progress, 5 and 6 not started yet
  - Notes : *Because I'm not using turrets as parts of the tank itself to prevent rotation delay, I have to manually place every assets which takes a lot of time : let's go slow on this one before I get bored*
- Pentadecimator

## Complexes :


## General :

- Make every assets used playable

## Tanks

- Spore Outbreak (tier 5 / 6 ?) :
  - Spore branch is team-limited upgrade, only 1/5 of player of the same team can use Spore Outbreak to prevent map infestation ?
  - Clone Strike upgrade
  - Complex and heavy design, no concept for now
  - Green themed
  - Shoots a capsule, freeing virulous spores poisoning nearbies entities
    - Spores might be heat bullets with random directions ? MOTION_TYPE: "colorthingy"
    - Make the capsule shakes when its about to explode
      - What if destroyed before? -> Probably releases a non-mature state, making spores slower and fewer
    - The capsule also releases gaz (butane?) that lasts in time, shrinks with time and disappear after 60 seconds.
      - Gaz only inflicts poison effect and cannot be destroyed
      - Torch-like tanks can ignite the gaz to make it disappear
- Neurologist (tier 6 / 7) :
  - Spore Outbreak upgrade
  - Same as Spore Outbreak but if spores hits an ally, it enhances speed and FOV by 10%, effect would be called "Synergy ?". 2 colorthingy bullets would orbit around a player being synergized
- Protrusion (tier 6 / 7) :
  - Spore Outbreak upgrade
  - Spores create corrupted tanks, probably really small minions, independant, looking for
